  caveats <<~EOS
    Notch Usage is not notarized yet. On first launch macOS blocks it: open
    System Settings → Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway".

    Before uninstalling, in the panel: turn off "Follow Claude Code" (it
    removes the app's hook entries from ~/.claude/settings.json; left behind,
    they do nothing) and sign out (it deletes the app's Keychain entries,
    which `brew uninstall --zap` cannot remove).
